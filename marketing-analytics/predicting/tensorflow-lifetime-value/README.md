This folder refers to a solution published in another Github repository about predicting Customer Lifetime Value using two main approaches:

1. RFM statistical models
2. Neural network models

You can find the code at [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-lifetime-value](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-lifetime-value)

The Github repository is a companion code to a four-part series that discusses how you can predict customer lifetime value (CLV) by using AI Platform (AI Platform) on Google Cloud. The articles in this series include the following:

- [Part 1: Introduction](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/clv-prediction-with-offline-training-intro). Introduces customer lifetime value (CLV) and two modeling techniques for predicting CLV.
- [Part 2: Training the model](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/clv-prediction-with-offline-training-train). Discusses how to prepare the data and train the models.
- [Part 3: Deploying to production](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/clv-prediction-with-offline-training-deploy). Describes how to deploy the models discussed in Part 2 to a production system.
- [Part 4: Using AutoML Tables](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/clv-prediction-with-automl-tables). Shows how to use AutoML Tables to build and deploy a model.
