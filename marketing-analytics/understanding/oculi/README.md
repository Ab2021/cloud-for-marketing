# Oculi

Oculi is a Google Cloud-based pipeline for tagging large sets of images or
videos with labels based on their content, generating a BigQuery dataset for
further analysis. Content tagging is done through Cloud's pre-trained computer
vision models (Vision API and Video Intelligence API).

The primary use case is for analyzing creatives (images and videos) in digital
advertising. Combined with creative performance data, the output from this
pipeline can be used to explore correlations between advertising content and
performance (e.g. creatives with a human model tend to perform better).

**Oculi is available in its own repository at github.com/google/oculi.**
